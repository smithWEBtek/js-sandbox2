    You are given a string s and an array of strings words of the same length. Return all starting indices of
    substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once, in any order, and without any
    intervening characters.

    You can return the answer in any order.



    Example 1:

    Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
    Output: [0,9]
    Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
    The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
    Example 2:

    Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
    Output: []
    Example 3:

    Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
    Output: [6,9,12]


    Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <=104 s consists of lower-case English letters. 1 <=words.length <=5000 1 <=words[i].length <=30
      words[i] consists of lower-case English letters. </P>
